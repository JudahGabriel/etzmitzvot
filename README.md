# EtzMitzvot - The interactive Biblical commandments tree 
A D3 chart of the 613 Biblical commandments

<ul>
<li>Defines each biblical commandment as TypeScript class, containing references to its children. This generates the data.</li>
<li>Pipes the hierarchical data to D3 to generate an interactive chart.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> Follow the project details and commentary over the next few years as we <a href="http://judahgabriel.blogspot.com/search/label/commandments%20hierarchy"> build the entire hierarchy from scratch</a>, and have a look at the latest snapshot of our work over at <a href="http://etzmitzvot.com">EtzMitzvot.com</a>.</p>
